This Hugo theme was ported from [Ivy](https://github.com/dmulholland/ivy), a minimalist website generator built in Python. I don't have time to document it. You have to read the source code to understand what it can do. Like Ivy, this theme is also released under [the Unlicense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlicense), which basically means you just do whatever you want. All I can say for now is that I love it. It is clean, minimal, and responsive.

I hope you will enjoy this theme. The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy). Happy hacking!
